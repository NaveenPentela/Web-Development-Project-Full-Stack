# Group Task List Manager (GTLM)
Software Specification
Below is an intentionally brief overview of a software system. You are to review the content and determine how best to design a prototype system. You will need to design, prototype and demonstrate your solutions in four cycles across the semester. Each demonstration will be an opportunity for feedback from the client. You will have opportunities throughout the semester for clarification of system functions and user groups. You should expand on the
service descriptions below â€“ you are free to expand the functionality as necessary.

You have been approached by your company to design and build a task list management tool hosted as a web service. This task list management tool is intended to track the job requirements for individuals and groups as well as allowing supervisor and/or admin users access to complete task details. This software system is intended to:

run on a web platform (targeting the Chrome browser),
allow the user to create a task list of jobs to be completed,
let the user define additional, specific details for each task in their list,
provide additional functionality to sort, edit, and group tasks,
allow multiple users to be added to a group and share common tasks,
provide administration access to control groups, task settings, and other non-core user details, and
provide supervisors with the ability to view individual or group tasks for those they oversee
As indicated by the list of features above, there will be a diverse range of users and interfaces required.

# Initial Front End Web Experience
You will demonstrate the initial functionality of your web application. This prototype alpha should demonstrate a functional system supported by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It should be apparent from this prototype the integration of design ideas from Cycle 1, integration of feedback from the client, and a standard visual "brand" appropriate for your app. The app itself will need to be demonstrated live with all intended functionality operational.

During your demonstration you will need to have one group member "driving" the interactions while other group members talk about features, implementations/changes from the design, and the technologies utilised. You will also be expected to show your source code and clearly demonstrate good structure, formatting, naming conventions and code efficiency.

Before your oral presentation during your tutorial you will be required to submit a zip of your project to this assignment submission box.

# Full Stack Web Experience
You will be required to demonstrate the final implementation of the GTLM system. This will include integration with backend database and suitable PHP scripting. This prototype beta should demonstrate a functional system supported by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Your web application should be successfully running on an AMPPS server and demonstrating real time interactions.

During your demonstration you will need to have one group member "driving" the interactions while other group members talk about features, implementations/changes from the previous phase, and the technologies utilised. You will also be expected to show your source code and clearly demonstrate good structure, formatting, naming conventions and code efficiency.

Before your oral presentation during your tutorial you will be required to submit a zip of your project to this assignment submission box.


# Professor Feedback for the project outcome

Your work is exceptional and clearly shows an understanding of the user-centric approach to completeness of functionality. The quality of your submission was exceptional. You have clearly understand the importance of user experience and have applied key design aspects in your website that are focused for the target audience. Your code structure was very good. There was good formatting applied to your code. There was demonstration of careful consideration for minimising repetition and redundancy in your code. Your comments were expressive and conveyed a clear understanding of the code you have written and aids future developers to understand your work but Needs more comments.

Report Feedback: Exceptional formatting, good layout, spelling grammar. A very professional looking report. Exceptional presentation of the usability testing regime conducted. Clear description of the tasks, surveys, observations, and interviews conducted. Exceptional presentation and discussion of results. The report provides a clear and logical discussion of predictive analytics, GOMS, and KLM. It covers these models with a good level of detail and analysis. The audience can easily understand the concepts and their applications. With a few refinements and more in-depth analysis, this presentation could reach an exceptional level of quality. Recommendations were clearly supported by the data gathered and insights generated from that data. You have demonstrated a comprehensive and complete understanding of the importance of the UX Evaluation process in creating effective user centric software.
